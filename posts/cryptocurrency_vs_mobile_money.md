The way many people see mobile money is so distinct from what it actually is. I live in China where e-payment is pretty much the most familiar form of transaction in the country. The Chinese often ask me, do you have payment options like WeChat and Alipay, or questions like digital payments or cash which are more prevalent in your country? And believe me, China is way ahead of pretty much any other country in digitization. And they did in such a short time and adopted it nationwide.

There is a misconception that Mobile money functions just like Alipay or WeChat but using phone numbers as accounts and calling credit/broadband as credit/money something like WhatsApp for payment for instance. This belief is wrong, not even close.

Mobile money and payment apps work verily distinct in both their mechanisms and policies. But this article will focus on the comparison between mobile money and cryptocurrency.

Is mobile money more secure, is it more efficient, is it faster, is it cheaper, all these questions lead to a big NO! It’s a crystal clear answer and here is why.

First of all, when comparing these two, there are factors to consider which we will categorically determine to know which system has the upper hand.

## Factors to consider:

1. Fee Structure
2. Usability
3. Accessibility
4. Reliability

### Fee Structure

The fee structure of a monetary system is the #1 factor to consider when choosing a payment system. The fee structure can make or break a payment system, it can also make or break the users and the community of the system.

Cryptocurrencies have transaction fees anywhere from $0.000001 to $2.5. Some cryptocurrencies like in Setheum charge transaction fees in weights (bytes) providing onem of the cheapest fee structure around while others like ethereum offer more expensive fees of up to hundreds of dollars (not the ideal fee structure here — I know but still better than percentages in mobile money, so Setheum is better used here). It’s common to transact cryptocurrency of more than $1 million with a very low transaction fee of $1 for instance, contrary to the percentage fee structure in banks, mobile money, swift, or any other form of remittance.

With mobile money, the fee structure is chaotic, the transaction fees range anywhere from 1% up to 15%. And the more money you send the cheaper the fees, which invites inequality.

Unlike cryptocurrency, mobile money charges you more when you send less, cryptocurrency charges you less when you send less, especially in the case of Setheum and Polkadot where fees are based on weight/bytes that they occupy in a transaction.

Regressive pricing structures often mean that those with lower incomes, who are more likely to make small transactions, end up paying higher fees on a percentage basis. Digital financial services, such as mobile money, have the potential to provide the poor with affordable access to formal financial tools, but regressive price structures might limit the potential benefits for this segment of the population. So unfair and inefficient.

Cryptocurrency clearly won this category with a 7 star rating, while mobile money is completely rekt.

### Usability

Usability is a measure of how well a specific user in a specific context can use a product to achieve a defined goal effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily.

So, how usable is mobile money? I would say as far as I know not that usable but pretty much does the job right? Wrong. The job is to transact seamlessly, securely, efficiently, affordable with the best experience possible. Cryptocurrency offers al the usability factors except one in some cases, just and only just in some cases cryptocurrency might not be a great experience in places where the convenient experiences are not offered, for example Nigeria, I remember the first time I bought cryptocurrency back in 2017 in Nigeria it was a horrible experience, but it got a lot better now. Today in most 3rd world countries that need remittance systems like that of Setheum’s transactions, it is hard to get the convenient experience that props usability and adoption.

There are good payment systems out there that offer nice experiences that rival that of banking experience, but they are mostly offered in 1st world countries like the USA, UK, Germany, Switzerland, et al. We need to make this experience a global phenomena that pros usability, adoption and accessibility. And we at Setheum Labs are tackling it head to head with the best solutions that offer the best experience that props usability, adoption.

### Accessibility

For cryptocurrency to do what everyone is so excited about it’s doing — decentralising currency and creating an international currency system — we need to make it global and accessible.

In a [WIRED interview](https://www.wired.com/story/for-women-in-cryptocurrency-a-new-effort-to-grow-their-ranks/), Jalak Jobanputra, managing partner and founder of Future\Perfect Ventures, said that for this democratisation to occur, the cryptocurrency industry must promote more widespread inclusion of all groups of people. “We need to make sure this phase of technology doesn’t go the way of the Internet, with everything happening in one place, one demographic deciding how this stuff gets built out and how we use it,” said Jobanputra.

In every one of the many changes to global economic systems throughout history, it has generally been wealthy white men who have reaped the most benefits. Despite its promise to decentralise and democratise, the cryptocurrency market is on track to repeat this pattern — unless we make it more accessible. Doing this is primarily a design challenge. If we can create intuitive user experiences for cryptocurrency, the industry will be able to access a mainstream audience and reach the ambitious goal of a globalised, globalised currency. There are three primary areas of focus we can start working on right now, and Setheum is taking them head to head with payment solutions unlike any other to make a difference.

1. Easier onboarding
2. More everyday transactions
3. Organised storage
4. Reliability

Today, cryptocurrency is becoming so accessible everywhere, you can buy any cryptocurrency with your Visa or MasterCard today wherever you are whatever the time is.

Unlike cryptocurrency, mobile money is not as accessible as it seems to be, you have to deposit cash if you don’t have a bank account, whereas you can even get a cryptocurrency debit card for almost free without having to own a bank account in many places.

Mobile money though is more available OTC than cryptocurrency in many countries especially in developing countries like Nigeria where I’m from. During this pandemic though, the best solution is definitely not holding cash and to an extent not mobile money. Cash was quarantined here in China in the early days of the coronavirus, because it was reported to be an active agent for the spread of the epidemic which became a pandemic. And OTCs are not the best options for sure. Setheum Labs is working on that head to head with the development of the Setheum Blockchain that provides the best cryptocurrency system and payment system yet.

Cryptocurrency again won this category while mobile money fell behind.

### Reliability

I haven’t used any mobile money provider yet, but I’ve interviewed a couple of mobile money users from various countries in Africa and what I found out was surprising. As an average East African layman, mobile money does not give you the ability to transact between your family and friends or to even use it as a payment gateway for your storefront, your customer can’t buy something from you and send you the money directly. So basically mobile money is not a reliable replacement for cash nor is it a reliable remittance system.

Mobile money has a lot of reliability issues, one example is that operators / third party providers are involved, and they can increase or decrease fees as they wish, they can refuse to attend to a certain customer/user. They can bury transactions. They can go out of business anytime and they can leave certain areas / locations for others. It’s not done this way in cryptocurrencies and public blockchains like Setheum, Polkadot, Bitcoin, Ethereum et al. The blockchain is decentralized and it is very unlikely and almost impossible to go out of business. The blockchain fee structure is not controlled by a person or a few persons, it is governed by a global community.

Human errors are very unlikely especially in fully decentralised cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Setheum where the monetary policy implementation is fully algorithmic and on-chain, and all holders of Setheum coins have a say in the governance of the blockchain where you can propose a referendum and all coin holders can vote to pass it or not. Mobile money or anything else including banks come nowhere close to the reliability and community benefits of cryptocurrency. Check Setheum’s Monetary Mechanism for more on how the algorithmic and decentralized Setheum financial system works to eliminate the above reliability issues uniquely to make a difference.

Cryptocurrency again won this category while mobile money falls mega far behind.
