Did you know that most cryptocurrencies will almost certainly never be as useful to the masses? The laymen who are looking to efficiently spend and earn their daily bread through a much more reliable form of currency and payment system, but have no choice because the existing cryptocurrencies are mostly focused on engaging with the technology and the price charts.

And of course also due to the fact that they cannot have easy access to these cryptocurrencies, and more importantly the price volatility that comes with a relatively small market like bitcoin compared to fiat or gold.

The liquidity of cryptocurrencies have totally different meanings to the masses compared to the cypherpunks, crypto enthusiasts, investment funds and traders.

To the masses, liquidity simply means the level of familiarity and transfer-ability in their local community, so how easy is it to buy groceries with this, how easy is it to keep track of my spending habits (the blockchain is actually best at that than anything), how stable is this currency, why is it better that my local bank account and currency (the most important, shadows all the rest), how easy is it to exchange this for another currency, how large is the community that actually spends and accepts this as legal tender in my community and my favourite malls and souqs, how popular and accredited is it on the online services I trust, so what is the PPP (purchasing power parity).

These are the simple concerns of a layman about any currency, so basically how is this convincing enough to convert the layman into using, earning, spending and trading this currency?

The multiple answers that we’ve seen as a result of this speculation, is the birth of stablecoins, cryptocurrencies that are pegged to fiat currencies in price and as some of them are backed by fiat in the bank like Tether, some are backed by other cryptocurrencies like in the case of Maker DAO.

But there is an issue of centralisation with most if not all of the popular stablecoins out there. And issues have emerged concerning the legitimisation of their practises.

Tether (USDT) for example, was known to be involved in a lot of scandal controversies, you can check Tether’s $850 million Controversy — Forbes, and Tether’s 20 Billion dollar scandal — Hackernoon, and here, and most importantly to the topic of centralisation and the human error involved in minting from a central trigger at one man’s finger tip — check here Tether ‘accidentally’ minted $5 billion worth of Tether tokens over the weekend, sending the price of Bitcoin down significantly — CoinRivet.
