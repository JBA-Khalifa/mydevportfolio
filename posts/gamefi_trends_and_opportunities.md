GameFi, derived from two very popular words, namely “gaming” and “finance”. It is a combination of Decentralised Finance (DeFi), which serves the financialization of the Games, and NFTs, which serve as collectibles embedded into the games, therefore DeFi and NFTs serving as both backend and frontend alongside the game engine. GameFi is financializing and democratizing fun and ownership in the metaverse.

GameFi makes it possible for gamers to earn while having fun in the games they play as well as owning their in-game digital assets such as avatars, costumes, land, and more. It also allows gamers and artists as well as developers to monetize their in-game creation as NFTs on the blockchain.

As per August data (2022), GameFi as an industry, accounts for over half of the blockchain industry usage month-over-month(MoM). The data from a DappRadar survey based on the Unique Active Wallets(UAW) in the industry shows that there is around $698 million in transactions related to around 847,230 GameFi-related UAW. Despite the reduction in usage month-over-month(MoM) compared to July, the GameFi sector is still seeing enormous usage as well as enormous investments, we will get to that in a bit.

GameFi gamifies DeFi, financializes gaming, and commodifies NFTs in-game. CryptoKitties, Uniswap, Roblox, few would have thought that these 3 would be intertwined in one and even more fun. These together with a slightly different approach, advanced developer tools and great ideas, have evolved into what we now know as the GameFi industry. The now more complex NFT Games enable more than just creating, owning, and trading collectibles.

GameFi enables users to:
- Generate passive income from staking;
- Impact the state and development of the game by building virtual worlds and other in-game collectibles;
- Participate in the Governance of the Project;
- Develop/Import NFTs for in-game usage, i.e. weapons, tactical gears, costumes et al.;
- Participate in Complex Financial Operations in a fun environment and earn yield;

## Current GameFi Trends

In GameFi, games can evolve into their own ecosystems/mini-economies with vast in-game micro-economies. Axie Infinity has become its own mini-economy, generating around $2.3 billion revenue. In fact, Axie Infinity’s NFT marketplace is second only to OpenSea, at over $3.9 billion total trading volume. The factors that made this industry so successful and growing are many, but amongst them are the current trends that I mention below, here are the trends in the NFT Gaming industry (GameFi);

- GameFi Aggregators: Gamers on GameFi Aggregators can explore existing and upcoming games across multiple blockchains. Aggregators also allow users to manage their in-game NFTs, track earnings, and also demo mini-games. GameFi Aggregators are a one-stop shop for all tokens, promotions, game releases, and more. This is a huge investment opportunity, and aggregators will have the chance to further expand beyond gaming into other NFT realms such as music royalties, art collections, rentables, and more.
- GameFi player Guilds for new users: As the GameFi community pushes to include new gamers, one of the challenges is the upfront investment needed to get started. As Games become more costly to get started, there is a need to lower the entry barrier. For example, Axie Infinity costs over hundreds of dollars to purchase. That cost is pretty unaffordable for a lot of players. This is something game designers need to solve in the long run through the internal economics of their games. Until then, funding pools have formed Gaming Guilds to help beginners finance their initial expenses through “scholarships” in exchange for a revenue-sharing agreement.
- IGO (Initial Game Offering) Launchpads Kickstarting new Games: Like we’ve seen DeFi LaunchPads offering IEOs, ICOs, IDOs et al, there are also GameFi Launchpads that offer IGO, helping GameFi projects raise funds to build and launch their Games and provide it to the public. IGO investors fund a game’s development in return for discounts or access to special features before a game launches.
- NFT & Gaming Blockchains: Since CryptoKitties, the industry has realized that GameFi transactions can get pretty congested on a blockchain like Ethereum, taking more than 20% of all traffic on the Ethereum network back in 2017. Blockchains that are specifically catering to NFTs and gaming are growing as GameFi is growing too. These application specific blockchains are customized to handle GameFi operations.
- Traditional games starting to explore GameFi: Some of the major companies in the traditional gaming industry, such as Electronic Arts, Gameloft and others have recently got more interested in the GameFi industry and are focusing their attention on this lucrative industry. It would be amazing to have blockchains support the playing of their games.
- Traditional gamers switching to GameFi: Although traditional video games often encourage players to buy in-game items, the value of these assets is rarely allowed to be actively traded for freal-world currency. On the other hand, the NFT in-game assets in GameFi are recorded on the blockchain, meaning that these assets can be traded, transferred, and exchanged for fungible currency.

## Future Investment Opportunities in GameFi

GameFi is a rapid growing sector, and as it grows, there are some interesting future investments opportunities that will have investors knocking on the doors of the projects catering to the needs of this fast growing and lucrative industry with tonnes of funding, where do we see there projects with high potential that are placed for huge investment opportunities, here we go.

- Highly Scalable Projects:
Scalability is still a headache for many blockchains as it is a thirst waiting to be quenched for the GameFi sector. As Web3 gaming becomes more and more popular, more and more people become daily active users and perform a lot of transactions, current blockchain networks do not possess the ability to accommodate the large influx of GameFi users, therefore, scalability is a very attractive opportunity, definitely the most important of all categories as this opens new doors to possibilities that even further enhance all the industry as a whole making it easier, and cheaper for all GameFi business to operate on such a blockchain.

Any blockchain that solves this issue with efficiency and maintains a decent balance in the Trilemma Triangle will gain massive traction and the projects or games related to such blockchain could even be a challenge for traditional centralized games if it were to be highly scalable and on par with traditional systems. There are a lot of teams working tirelessly on bringing such solutions to the table for GameFi, some good examples are Setheum and Integritee.

- GameFi Aggregators:
GameFi spans across many different blockchains, with a plethora of projects scattered around these chains, bringing order to all this chaos are GameFi Aggregators, they unify GameFi projects and portfolios and control into one user interface, they allow multi-chain GameFi features to be unified and aggregated.

- Cross-Chain Metaverse Projects:
Cross-Chain is incredibly difficult to build and secure, with all the bridge hacks going on, the projects to win this category with efficient cross-chain GameFi solutions will win really big, so this is a huge future investment opportunity, and with tons of projects working to solve this problem, this won’t be waiting all that long.

- NFTs:
Non-Fungible-Tokens(NFTs) are the backbone of GameFi, as this industry grows and demand keeps momentum, NFTs and NFT projects especially Gaming NFTs will be a good investment opportunity. In-Game NFTs are trending and in-game spendings world-wide are at ATH(All-Time-High) and are expected to surpass $74 Billion USD by 2025.

- NFT Decentralized Storage:
NFTs need to be stored somewhere, decentralized storage projects like IPFS and Filecoin continue to grow due to the rapid growth of this industry, projects in this category will be a good investment opportunity as long as NFTs are in use , which no doubt they are and they are in high demand.

- Optimized Free-to-Play (F2P) GameFi Games:
The P2E (Play to Earn) model in GameFi is just a stepping stone for more advanced and optimized hybrid models, the most ideal strategy is to build with hybrid F2P-P2E-P2W(Free-to-Play, Play-to-Earn & Pay-to-Win) models in GameFi.

F2P-P2W(Free-to-Play & Play-to-Win) is a monetization model that has been used by a countless number of popular and well respected titles, such as Roblox, League of Legends, Pokemon Go, Candy Crush, PubG, Subway Surfers, Fortnite, and many more in the traditional gaming industry.

Some of the most popular and most successful games in this category have proven that the Free-to-Play(F2P) games can be highly lucrative in a Pay-to-Win(P2W) and F2P hybrid model, without having to adopt paywalls for users.

F2P games let users play with a low barrier of entry, which allows players to play for free and use the PEW model to let users pay for in-game perks, gears and performance advantages such as in-game characters, energy boosters, health kits, weapons, weapon-enhancers, costumes et al.

These P2W purchases are typically low-cost, but in scale, these small purchases aggregate to massive compounded profits for the game. It works for all participants — small players get to play for free without having to start with an expensive in-game NFT entry barriers, big players get to pay their way to enhancements and the game itself gets to generate enough revenue to improve the game, burn project tokens to benefit the token holders, hire more researchers, developers and designers, and pretty much do whatever they want.

Since most GameFi projects require an upfront investment, some very interesting investment opportunities in GameFi would be the games that have implemented or will implement some form of this hybrid model.

Some Free-to-Play(F2P) GameFi games are “gods Unchained”, “The Sandbox, “Guild of Guardians”, “Chainmonsters”, “Splinterlands”, “Coin Hunt World”, “Axie Infinity Scholarship”, “Town Star”, “Galaxy Fight Club”, “Mirandus”, “Town Crush”, “Spider Tanks”.

## Conclusion

Overall, the GameFi sector is an amazing place to have fun and make money, it has seen growth and massive investments over the years and will continue to see more growth and even more investments, this might just be the beginning of a new era, for gaming it is.
