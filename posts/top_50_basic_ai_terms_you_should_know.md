**Bonus**: Just a bit more for those staying all along.

1. Fine-tuning: A technique in machine learning and deep learning where a pre-trained model, often a large language model like GPT or BERT, is further trained on a specific task or domain to improve its performance. Fine-tuning involves updating the weights of the pre-trained model using task-specific data, allowing the model to adapt and specialise for the target task. This approach leverages the knowledge and generalisation capabilities already learned by the pre-trained model, resulting in improved performance and faster convergence on the specific task at hand. Fine-tuning is commonly used in transfer learning scenarios, where a pre-trained model is applied to a new task with limited available data.

2. Weights: In the context of artificial neural networks, weights refer to the parameters that determine the strength and influence of connections between neurones. Each connection in a neural network is assigned a weight, which represents the importance of that connection in the overall computation. During the training process, the weights are adjusted iteratively to minimise the difference between the predicted output and the actual output, allowing the network to learn and make accurate predictions. The values of the weights influence the behaviour of the neural network, determining how input data is processed and transformed as it propagates through the network's layers. The process of updating and optimising the weights is a crucial aspect of training neural networks and is typically done using optimisation algorithms such as gradient descent. Proper initialisation and adjustment of weights play a vital role in the performance and effectiveness of neural network models.

3. LLM (Large Language Model): Advanced AI models, such as GPT-3, trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like text and perform various language-related tasks like translation and understanding.

4. Quantisation: A technique in AI and machine learning that reduces the memory and computational requirements of neural networks by representing numerical values with lower bit precision, improving efficiency and enabling deployment on resource-constrained devices.
